    "text": "There is so much happening all around us right now, a deluge of panic and uncertainty, bad news and fear, suffering and injustice. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed and to easily slip into familiar habits. Some of us retreat– we stop watching or reading or listening to the news and focus only on what’s in front of us. Some of us jump into action– organizing, contacting, checking up, adding new meetings to our schedules and to-dos to our list. Some of us spiral– should we start stocking up on canned food? Is now the time to look into residency requirements elsewhere. Some of us ping-pong between all three, hunkering down one day, over-committing the next, only to doom-spiral out at 1 a.m. watching videos about the perfect go-bag.\nAs we come to the end of this fourth week, I’ve found myself thinking often of pacing. We’re only about a month in– how will we ensure that we move at a pace we can sustain? How many of us, in the words of Anne Helen Peterson, are feeling this in our bodies right now? How can we create space to sit with the reality of this moment, to “see things as they really are,” and not forget the vital work of witness?\nIn times like these, I tend towards either action of avoidance. You will find me either completely offline or deep in the weeds of meetings and phone calls and cooking and organizing and whatever other task I’ve found that seems useful in the moment. Both of these reactions allow me to sidestep my complex and potentially overwhelming feelings, to stuff grief and hurt and anger and fear down for another day, to be dealt with in an undefined ‘later’ time. I avoid and act and avoid and act until finally the dam of feelings is breached, perhaps by a fight with my spouse, bad news from a friend, a task gone wrong and work– and suddenly I am drowning. Or perhaps these feelings transmute themselves into a spasming back or a sharp twinge in my right hip as my body pulls the brake on constant motion. Either way, we cannot avoid these feelings forever, through inaction or constant doing, distraction or determination.\nSo instead, let’s make room for the work of witness.\nThe work of witness asks us to stop for a moment– stop doing, stop avoiding, and be still. Look, listen, feel. Take in our current moment. See who is being harmed and who is determining what harm is done, who has power and who does not, who is speaking and who is silent, who is valued and who is discarded. Sit with the feelings that arise from your observation of the situation– anger, sadness, fear, joy, hope, terror, despair, grief, rage, pity, pride, disgust– as each feeling comes, greet it as a guest. Call it by name, and see what it has to tell you. Try as best you can not to judge the feelings or to jump to action, but rather to be present with whatever comes. Then, after some time, move to thinking about what you might do now. Perhaps you want to share what you felt with a friend or write it down. Maybe you want to call your congressperson and tell them what you are feeling. Perhaps there is something you can do to support those most in harm’s way. May we see and feel what is happening all around us and take the time to respect the weight of it. Then may we, together, choose to move towards caring for one another.\nThis week’s action and further reading\nI’ve included below a short selection of essays, articles, videos, and posts that capture some of the key concerns of this current moment in the U.S. as well as the continuing unfolding crises around the world. Pick one to read or watch, then sit and feel, and finally act.\n\nThe diary of a political scientist who was born in Nazi-occupied Poland: “Is democracy dying in the United States?”\nThe firing of civil servants: “a larger process in which elected leaders dismantle democracy from within”\nWhat this means for the Constitution: “There is no going back” article video\nNative Nations: “Life or death consequences”\nNational Parks Services: “You’re losing people that are keeping the bathrooms clean, the trails maintained. You’re losing people who are teaching youth the value of protecting and preserving these places for current and future generation”\nFederal workers: “I gave blood, sweat and tears to this country for 20 years to continue service to the federal government, doing what I was trained to do by them…I kind of feel like I was just thrown out like a piece of trash.”\nFAA firings: “Firing people that do this sort of work is not conducive to preventing accidents”\nResearch funding freezes: “The people most vulnerable in our society in terms of health and public safety are now even further at risk”\nCare for trans kids: “This is the last thing that we need to be worried about…a political system attacking our family”\nDeportations affecting families and their schools: “The spectre of deportation is driving people underground”\nThe refugee system collapse: “There might not be much of a refugee program left to recover”\nGlobal effects of dismantling USAID: “We are plugging leaks in a system that is a dam that’s about to burst”\nTuberculosis: What’s at stake: video\n\nAnd an accountability check:\nRemember those beautiful, lonely actions from last week? Here’s the ones I did:\n\nCalled my congresspeople, using the very helpful 5-Calls app\nSubscribed to a newsletter with helpful actions\nChecked in on federal workers I know\nMade sure I was up-to-date on union news (as a union member at my workplace)\nParticipated in a class on community organizing\n\nI plan to participate in a protest and connect with a community organization this week. Maybe I’ll see you out there."

    "text": "I have this written on a post-it stuck to my desktop screen because I desperately need this reminder. In times like these, I am prone to dive down a researching rabbit hole. I refresh news feeds– NPR, The Guardian, Slate, AP News. I put books about authoritarianism and tyranny and citizenship on hold at the library. I follow my Senators on social media and search their websites for press releases. If only I can learn more, know more, see more, surely I will feel better.\nBut I already know this is a lie.\nWhat I want is not to know more about how countries slide into authoritarianism or effective ways to build citizen power. What I want to know is what we all want to know.\nThat we will be safe.\nThat our families will be safe.\nThat we won’t lose our jobs.\nThat someone is going to do something about all this.\nThat ICE won’t show up at our kids’ school.\nThat our friend will get to keep their green card.\nThat our research funding won’t evaporate.\nThat some loophole is going to save us.\nThat the work we spent a decade on won’t be dismantled within days.\nThat somewhere there is some convincing argument that will get people on our side.\nWe want to be soothed. We want to know that in the end it will all turn out okay, that good will prevail. We are grasping frantically for a rope, a toehold, something to tether us in the face of fear, some kind of certainty.\nBut that certainty does not, cannot, exist.\nUncertainty is a fundamental part of being human.\nThe plain truth is that we were never safe. There is no power, no money, no structure, no knowledge, no belief that can fully insulate us from the uncertainty of this life in this world. The bottom can always drop out. We just usually don’t have to think about this.\nAnd in those times when the bottom does drop out– for an individual, a family, an entire country– we often turn quickly to easy explanations as self-protection.\n“She was pretty old,” we say to the friend whose grandmother died. Those I love are not that old, I say to myself.\n“Was he a smoker?” at the news of the lung cancer diagnosis. Good thing my parents never smoked.\n“God has a plan,” from the faithful folks. Let’s focus on some eventual good instead of acknowledging the current moment’s pain.\n“Their democracy was never that stable,” upon reading the headlines from that place on the other side of the world. We have a few more hundred years on our side.\n“They’ve been fighting each other for centuries,” at the news of the latest bombings. They are different from us.\n“Evil is real”, when reading about those historic atrocities. Of course I am a good person.\nThese small acts of distancing, of self-protection, of deflection move us away from the fears of the real truth– that those we love are fragile and will someday die, as will we. That we cannot ward off aging or cancer or cardiac arrest with just the right diet or exercise routine. That no country is immune to collapse or invasion or loss of freedom. That the ability to do incredible good and horrific evil lives in each one of us.\nThe internet can provide us all sorts of answers so quickly to so many other questions. Is “Ring around the Rosie” really about the plague? How long should I cook a soft-boiled egg? What is this mystery tool I found in my parents’ junk drawer? Of course we go looking for the bigger answers here too. We can read and scroll and pontificate and factcheck and argue in the comments. But we will not find the answer to our fears here.\nWhen I was in my 20s, my partner and I had a string of three quite-bad years. A brush with cancer. A string of hospitalizations and a major surgery. And finally, my dad’s sudden and completely unexpected death. The bottom dropped out. Some friends disappeared. But other friends and family members and colleagues and kind strangers caught us– with meals and mail, helping my mom run the family business in those first gutting few months, letting us sit sullen and angry and sad at the kitchen table while they made tea, hauling boxes, long phone calls, texts on the holidays and anniversaries, cash tucked in cards and unexpected Venmo notifications. None of these things made the pain disappear or the grief smaller. But they sustained us through.\nIt is normal, reasonable, rational to be afraid right now, to want reassurance that it will all be okay, but looking to the internet to provide that will either mislead us or spiral us deeper into fear. Instead, let’s pause. Breathe. Then look for the people who will sustain us through. Who can you connect with, ideally in-person, but by phone or handwritten note if need be? Whose voice makes you feel anchored? Nurture those connections, with coffee and tea, reading recommendations, movie nights, unexpected cash in envelopes, errand runs, care packages, pictures of baby animals, and more.\nThis is how we will sit with our fear, together, and not be overwhelmed, but be able to act.\n\nThis week’s action and further reading\nThink of someone whose company you enjoy, who makes you smile, or who you know loves you deeply. Write that person a physical note and mail or hand-deliver it to them. If you don’t have their address, ask them for it.\nThirty lonely but beautiful actions you can take right now\nFind your people IRL\nJoin a class\nThere are only 1,000 workdays in this administration. You’ve survived 20 of them. Get a chart (or make your own) and mark them off!\nWays to take in information without getting pulled under\nI have accepted that there are no guarantees that we can overcome all that we are facing. But I do know that unless we fight, we cannot prevail.\nMost of the trouble that afflicts human beings in their lives can be traced to the failure to love."
