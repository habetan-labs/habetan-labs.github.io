Breathe out.\nWe are in a time filled with fear, with uncertainty, with cruelty, with distraction, with noise. It is easy to feel overwhelmed, and we will feel overwhelmed and scared and angry and sad and all sorts of things.\nBreathe in. Breath out.\nBut we do not have to be paralyzed or controlled by our fear. This is a moment for being human and yet being brave.\nBreathe in. Breathe out.\nWe are embarking on an experiment. How, in these times, can we choose what we are for, not just what we are against?\nBreathe in. Breath out.\nCan we imagine an interwoven life where care is taken seriously, where care is treasured? How can we make that life possible? How can we live as if we truly believed that we only flourish together?\nBreathe in. Breathe out.\nThis is a space where we are going to try to move closer to that vision, despite the times. This is a collective space. This is a space with questions and not necessarily answers.\nBreathe in. Breath out.\nWe will be writing more in the coming days and weeks. Thank you for being here. We hope you will return.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{2025,\n  author = {, habetan-labs},\n  title = {Welcome},\n  date = {2025-02-07},\n  url = {https://habetan-labs.github.io/2025-02-07-welcome/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nhabetan-labs. 2025. “Welcome.” February 7, 2025. https://habetan-labs.github.io/2025-02-07-welcome/."
