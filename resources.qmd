## How we made this site

This site was made using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

This [guide from Sam Csik](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/) was invaluable in building this site. Sam's [guide on adding a quarto blog](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/) is also excellent.
