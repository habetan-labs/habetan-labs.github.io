Being quiet will not save you\ 
Being good will not save you\   
Following the rules will not save you at all\   
The rules can always be changed\   
\

Being small will not save you  
Being innocent will not save you   
Being young will not save you either   
Sometimes I think they fear youth most of all   

Being smart will not save you   
Being wise will not save you   
All the knowledge in the world will not save you   
Knowledge might mean you know too much   

Honesty will not save you   
Lies will not save you   
Oaths, allegiances, magic words have no power   
What is true and what is not does not matter anymore   

Strength will not save you   
Weakness will not save you   
Old age will not exempt you   
For they are afraid of even their shadows    

Money will not save you   
Investments will not save you   
You cannot buy your way out of this one   
What you could give they can also take   

Being white will not save you   
Being a citizen will not save you   
Being a man might help but will not be enough   
Anyone can be made out to be an enemy   

So what hope could we have then   
In the face of all this fear   


Only the warmth of a lover's hand   
The food from a neighbor   
The letter from a friend   
The weight of a child's body   
The shouts of our clamoring kin   
The determination that declares   
They may take one of us but   
They cannot take us all
